<p>He's an engineer student at EMINE School of Industrial Management at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Founder and Leader of Google Developer Student Club at UM6P 2021/22.</p>
<p>He's an engineer student passionate about finance and digital domain, driven by a motivation to put his full energy in what he loves in that world. This passion led him to challenge himself daily and learn new skills that helped him to grow.</p>
<p>Founding and leading a GDSC inside his university was one of these challenges and a life changing experience that helped him to develop leadership skills and teamwork. During this journey he learned new skills in the technical side as in the non-technical side, he made new connection either in his university, Morocco or even the MENA region, and learned about new opportunities.</p>
<p>And due to his education at EMINES he had a technical background in different fields from the best professors, like Analytics Edge and optimization methods by Pr. DimitrisBertsimas, Macroeconomy from Pr. Pierre Noel Giraud, Control Engineering by Pr.
Sebastien Boisgerault, SPL by Pr. Frederic Fontane, Cost Evaluation by Pr. Frederic Kletz, Mining Strategy by Pr. Damien Goetz, Biomedical Engineering by Pr. Marcel Filoche and much more. That rich and varied learning path helped him to get the necessary skills to work on different projects and make them a success.</p>
