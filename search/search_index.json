Jihan Majdoul She is the lead of GDSC UCD, a BI Engineer and Data Analyst, a Competitive Programmer, driven by a love and passion from computer science, bringing her the the current stage where she became a Women Techmaker Ambassador and the Lead Organizer of GDG El Jadida. To define me as a self-learning person and curious about problem-solving, I've been doing c problem-solving, learning new practical skills and programming since my youth, I followed my way to computer science by love and passion, in the course of my university studies I have the opportunity to benefit from a curriculum based on computer and data science. As part of the preparation for my master's degree in business intelligence and big data analytics, I'm a Google Developer Student Clubs UCD lead and a Women Techmaker Ambassador. Currently looking forward to pursuing Data Science and Analytics as a career. 22'Lead of Google Developer Student Clubs Chouhaib Doukali University @GDSCUCD Mouncef Benouri He's an engineer student at EMINE School of Industrial Management at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Founder and Leader of Google Developer Student Club at UM6P 2021/22. He's an engineer student passionate about finance and digital domain, driven by a motivation to put his full energy in what he loves in that world. This passion led him to challenge himself daily and learn new skills that helped him to grow. Founding and leading a GDSC inside his university was one of these challenges and a life changing experience that helped him to develop leadership skills and teamwork. During this journey he learned new skills in the technical side as in the non-technical side, he made new connection either in his university, Morocco or even the MENA region, and learned about new opportunities. And due to his education at EMINES he had a technical background in different fields from the best professors, like Analytics Edge and optimization methods by Pr. DimitrisBertsimas, Macroeconomy from Pr. Pierre Noel Giraud, Control Engineering by Pr. Sebastien Boisgerault, SPL by Pr. Frederic Fontane, Cost Evaluation by Pr. Frederic Kletz, Mining Strategy by Pr. Damien Goetz, Biomedical Engineering by Pr. Marcel Filoche and much more. That rich and varied learning path helped him to get the necessary skills to work on different projects and make them a success. 22'Lead of Google Developer Student Clubs UM6P @GDSCUM6P Nizar Stitou I\u2019m Nizar Stitou, an ambitious and dedicated software engineering student with strong practical and technical skills.

Also, a passionate learner who is interested in learning new technologies such as Data Science, Machine Learning, and Web Development\u2026 I\u2019m the Founder & Leader of GDSC - ENSAK. I was so motivated to apply for GDSC Lead because I love the spirit of being in a strong and loving community that puts sharing on the top of everything.
